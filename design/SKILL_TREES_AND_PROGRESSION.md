# System Design: Skill Trees & Progression (Resistance Edition)

## 1. Core Philosophy

The progression systems are the engine of long-term engagement and a core part of the **narrative of rebellion**. They must reward the desired behaviors of the Resistance: clever communication, strategic resource management, and building resilient human bonds. The systems allow players to specialize into crucial **roles within the clandestine network**.

## 2. User Progression: The Emissary Tree (Resistance Roles)

-   **Earning XP:** XP is now framed as "Reputation" within the Resistance. The mechanics remain the same, but the narrative justification is stronger. A reply from across the world isn't just worth more XP; it's a testament to the network's strength and resilience, boosting your reputation.

-   **Spending Skill Points (Specializing in a Resistance Role):**

    -   **Class: `Ghost Runner` (formerly Postal Strategist):** A specialist in navigating the network quickly and unseen.
        -   `T4 Ultimate: Ráfaga Epistolar` is now `Sobrecarga de Datos`: A burst transmission that confuses El Conductor's sensors, allowing it to pass with reduced delay.
    -   **Class: `Cipher-Poet` (formerly Arcane Calligrapher):** A master of encoding deep meaning and emotion into seemingly benign data packets.
        -   `T4 Ultimate: Elocuencia` is now `Payload Emocional`: The ability to craft a message with an emotional resonance so potent it bypasses El Conductor's emotional dampening filters, ensuring the true meaning is felt.
    -   **Class: `Smuggler` (formerly Interdimensional Merchant):** An expert in moving resources and value through the network's "dark corners."
        -   `T4 Ultimate: Ofrenda Generosa` is now `Envío Clandestino`: Leverages a "zero-knowledge proof" (in-lore) to send a gift without leaving a traceable financial signature, a high-value skill for the Resistance.

## 3. AI Progression: The Silicon Counselor (Jailbroken AI)

The AI is a "jailbroken" fragment of El Conductor. "Training" it means feeding it data that helps it better understand and counteract its own source code.

-   **Earning Training Data:** Earning data is now explicitly an act of counter-surveillance.
    -   `+200 Data`: When the `Oracle of Silence` (now `Predictor de Interferencia`) correctly predicts that El Conductor will "garble" your message, you've successfully identified a weak point in the surveillance network, providing valuable data.
    -   `+500 Data (Weekly Bonus)`: "Donating" an anonymized conversation summary is now framed as "Cargando Registros de Anomalías al Repositorio de la Resistencia."

-   **Spending Training Data (Installing "Rogue Modules"):**
    -   You install "Rogue Modules" or "Exploits" into your AI's core.
    -   `Oracle of Silence` is renamed `Predictor de Interferencia`.
    -   `Essay and Error` is renamed `Análisis de Firma Digital`, which simulates if a message will be flagged as "anomalous" by El Conductor.

## 4. Relationship Progression: The Friendship Tree (The Clandestine Bond)

This tree represents the strength and security of a "célula" (cell) of the Resistance, formed by two users.

-   **Earning Bond Points:** Points are now "Puntos de Confianza." A successful photo exchange isn't just a social achievement; it's a successful transfer of high-risk, uncorrupted data, a major victory against El Conductor.

-   **Leveling Up the Bond:**
    -   Leveling up your Vínculo is now "Fortaleciendo el Cifrado de la Célula."
    -   Each level makes your connection more resilient to El Conductor's interference.
    -   **Lore Integration:** The ability to send photos (`Level 3`) is possible because your cell's encryption is now strong enough to hide a high-bandwidth data packet. The final level's emergency chat is a "Canal Cuántico Seguro" that is, in theory, completely invisible to El Conductor.

## 5. System Integrity: Resisting The Conductor

-   **Active Abilities Cooldowns:** The cooldowns represent the time needed for your custom hardware/software to "re-calibrate" and "borrar las huellas" after performing a high-risk action that might have alerted El Conductor.
-   **Intimacy Tokens (`Tokens de Confianza`):** These represent the social and technical capital needed to attempt a high-risk data transfer (photo/voice). A failed attempt (rejection) means the "exploit" was wasted, and the token is lost.
